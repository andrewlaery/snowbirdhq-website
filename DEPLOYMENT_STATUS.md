# Deployment Status Check

## ✅ Local Build Verification

- Build passes successfully with no errors
- Tailwind CSS is properly configured and generating styles
- Custom Snowbird blue color (#B5D3D7) is included in CSS output
- All responsive classes are working correctly
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- ESLint passes with no warnings

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.2 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- **Build Output**: Static pages generated correctly
- **CSS Generation**: 7.7KB CSS file with all necessary styles
- **Custom Colors**: `bg-snowbird-blue` class correctly generates `rgb(181 211 215)`

## 🚨 Issue Identified

The deployed version at snowbirdhq.com appears to be missing styles, suggesting:

1. **Old Deployment**: The live site might be an old deployment
2. **Build Configuration**: Different build process on deployment
3. **Domain Mismatch**: Domain might be pointing to wrong deployment
4. **Cache Issue**: Browser or CDN cache showing old version

## 🛠️ Recommended Actions

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: Verify latest deployment timestamp
2. **Force Redeploy**: Trigger new deployment with current code
3. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Verify Domain**: Ensure domain points to correct Vercel deployment
