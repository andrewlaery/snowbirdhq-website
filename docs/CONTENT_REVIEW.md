# Content Review Checklist

For each page, mark each row:
- ☐ not yet reviewed
- 🔍 in progress
- ✅ reviewed + approved
- ⚠️ issue noted, fix pending

## Review dimensions (per page)
1. **Accuracy** — does every claim match reality (addresses, appliance models, emergency numbers, check-in instructions)?
2. **Completeness** — are any placeholders, TODOs, or obvious gaps remaining?
3. **Consistency** — matches the structure/tone of the corresponding page on other properties?
4. **Sensitive data** — no plaintext credentials, no PII, no vendor phone/email, no security codes?
5. **Vault artefacts** — no wiki-links (`[[...]]`), no dataview blocks, no stray Obsidian frontmatter (`tags:` should be stripped by sync script), no Obsidian comments?
6. **Readability** — no typos, clear headings, appropriate length, works on mobile?

## Review process per page

1. Open the page in a browser using a Short.io link (or `docs.snowbirdhq.com/docs/properties/{slug}/{page}?access=<DOCS_ACCESS_KEY>`)
2. Scan through all 6 dimensions with the user
3. Fix issues in the corresponding Obsidian vault `.md` file (NOT the MDX)
4. Re-sync: `./scripts/sync-property-compendium.sh --only {slug}`
5. Re-verify in browser
6. Commit with message `content({slug}/{page}): review pass — <short note>`
7. Mark ✅ on the checklist, commit the checklist update in a separate commit.
